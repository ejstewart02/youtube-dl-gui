# Design Patterns
- Left to right, precedence, like file ext. needs format to be selected. Url before download
- Buttons dynamically disable.enable based on state, like pasted  url, or downloading
- Things that dont need to be showed, like pbar, are not
- url at top and not in frame to catch eye
- options are set to viable defaults - paste and download, no more
